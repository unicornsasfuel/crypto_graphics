Experiments in visualizing cryptography


This is a repository for various visualization tools and rendered visualizations of cryptographic topics, for educational and research purposes.

Some of these tools may implement ciphers such as AES or RC4. These are not written or intended to be hardened, attack-resistent implementations and should never be used in production. Please use some high level interface like KeyCzar or NaCl if you want something to use to actually protect data.
